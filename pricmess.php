		<u><h2> Principal's Message</h2></u>
		<p>Dear Students<br><br>We are well aware that there is a desperate need to save our Mother Earth from the existing environment concerns like global warming, deforestation, air/water pollution, urban extension, over-population, waste disposal, ozone layer depletion, soil degradation, ocean acidification and climate change.<br><br>
			We , at Ramanujan College, have our genuine commitments towards making our campus eco-friendly. The installation of Solid Waste Disposal Machine, Five Electronic Waste Bins, Bio-tiolets, LED Lights, collaboration with E-Waste and Paper Recycling companies are some of the key efforts in this direction. Even our new building is equipped with gigantic sewage treatment plant, solar panels and rainwater harvesting structure.<br><br>
			In order to develop sense of accountability and respect towards natural resources, engagement of youth  in various community development activities and enhancement of environmental conciousness and action among the society, Ramanujan College has established the Tatva: Eco Club. It falls under Delhi Government's Department of Environment. The activities of Eco club are not only to learn about bio-diversity and sustainable growth models but also to keep the campus clean and ecologically viable.<br><br>
			Dr. B. C. Sabata, Senior Scientific officer, Department of Environment, Government of NCT of Delhi has been associated with Tatva: Eco Club since its inception and has been providing guidance and assistance in its successful operation.<br><br>
			We can save our environment in a very easy manner with the little steps taken by every individual on the earth. So, let us join our hands together and save our planet earth by making it green and clean.<br><br>
			Dr. S. P. Aggarwal<br>
			Principal</p>
