		<u><h2> Convenor's Message</h2></u>
		<p>Dear Students<br><br>Environment is important to all living beings and its continous degradation is a growing cause of concern. There is a need to bring a change in the knowledge, attitude and practices to recognize the significance of environment upon which depends the survival of human race and ecology.<br><br>
			The Tatva: Eco Club of Ramanujan College work towards Environmental Alertness, Sustainability, Community Sensitization, Youth Mobilization and Meaningful Participation for the Better and Healthy surrounding.<br><br>
			Our Eco Club is actively involved in carrying out cleaniness drives, tree-plantation and E-waste drives, anti-cracker campaigns during Deepawali, field visits to Bio-diversity Parks, lectures by eminent environmentalists, tie-up with NGO's and Paper Recycling units, sensitizing masses to create awareness on the importance of segregation of waste.<br><br>
			The Eco Club invites students interested in working towards environment and willing to participate in making our surrounding better and sustainable.<br><br>
			Let's go green and be the change we want to see in the world. Each one of us can make a difference.<br><br>
